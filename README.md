# Fix

Fix is my take on a build system. It's written in Perl, and runs on GNU/Linux.
Apart from its dependency on Perl it tries hard to be very minimalistic. (There
are no other dependencies.)

It is mostly inspired by `redo` and `git` (for a more complete list of sources
of inspirations, see “[Inspiration and
References.](//github.com/zrajm/fix/wiki/Inspiration-and-References)” on the
wiki).

As you can see it is not quite finished yet, but if you want to have a sense of
where it is going, you can have a look at its [GitHub wiki
pages](//github.com/zrajm/fix/wiki), or the [TODO](TODO.txt). – If you want to
know how it works, fetch the [fix](fix) program, make sure its executable, and
run `fix --man` to have a look at the manpage (or just play around with it for
a bit).

I've mostly put this repository here in order to have somewhere to point people
who have expressed an interest. More to come.
