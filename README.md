# Fix

Fix is my take on a build system. It is inspired by `redo` and `git`.

It's written in Perl, and runs on GNU/Linux.

As you can see it is not quite finished yet, but if you want to have a sense of
where it is going, you can take a look at the
[TODO](https://github.com/zrajm/fix/blob/master/TODO.txt). â€“ If you want to
know how it works, fetch the file
[fix](https://github.com/zrajm/fix/blob/master/fix), make sure its executable,
and run `fix --man` to have a look at the manpage (or just play around with it
for a bit).

I've mostly put this repo here in order to have somewhere to point people who
have expressed an interest. More to come.
